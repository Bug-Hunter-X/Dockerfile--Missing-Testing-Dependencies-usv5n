This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to install necessary dependencies.  The original Dockerfile attempts to run unit tests using Python's `unittest` module, but fails because `unittest` is not installed in the base image.  The solution demonstrates the proper way to install dependencies before running the tests.  The solution also includes more explicit instructions which are more robust.
